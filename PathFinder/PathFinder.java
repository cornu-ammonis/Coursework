// NOTE - this file contains three nested static classes at the
// bottom of the file (which I wrote myself, consulting the Sedgwick 
// book in the case of the minheap) -- much of the magic happens here. 
// I would normally put these in separate files, but nesting made it  
// easier when repeatedly uploading to mimir for testing.
//
// The classes are as follows:
//
// @CLASS PositionLN, or position listed neighbor, extends Position 
// and implements Comparable<PositionLN> - it has a listNeighbors()
// method which will list the 4 reachable neighbors of an 
// open position and the 8 of a wall (conveniently delineating so that
// it can be reused between findpath and findwallpath)
// it also has a distance property which is used to A* search, and 
// a its compareTo method is based on this property,
// which makes it easier to implement the custom minHeap queue for A*
//
// @CLASS PhantomPosition - extends PositionLN - differs from PositionLN
// in that its listNeighbors function instead returns all positions
// in the first column or last row (j == 0 or i == N-1)
// this allows us to implement bfs on a "range" of starting positions 
// for the findWallPath algorithm. when reconstructing the path, 
// PhantomPosition is omitted, so the final result is a path of just walls
// which is one of the shortes possible paths (or null if DNE)
//
// @CLASS MinHeapOfPositions creates a min heap of PositionLN arranged
// according to their distance value so that we can have an efficient
// "priority queue" (not using the actual queue API, 
// because its not needed and would violate the rules of the hw)
// for A* search. It has a removeMin method, an add method, and an 
// isEmpty() method.

// Deleted all non-clarifying comments from the original file

// Given a maze of size N, the method findPath(maze) finds an open
// path from (0,0) to (N-1,N-1), if such a path exists.
//
// See main() comments for its command line usage.

// TODO: the current solution is recursive (dfs() calls itself).  You
// need to make it non-recursive.  One way is to use an explicit stack
// instead of the runtime stack.  You do not need to find exactly the
// same open paths as found by the given code.

// TODO(EC): modify findPath so it finds a *shortest* open path from
// (0,0) to (N-1,N-1), when one exists.  You can read about a method
// for this, "breadth first search", in Section 4.1 of your book.

// TODO(EC): define method findWallPath (it currently returns null).
// When findPath fails to find a path, there should be a "blocking"
// path of walls separating S and T.  This path can start at any wall
// on the top row or right column of the maze (i==0 or j==N-1), and
// end at any wall at the bottom row or left column of the maze
// (i==N-1 or j==0).  Two walls can be adjacent by a cardinal step OR
// a diagonal step (so, each wall has 8 potential neighbors).  Again,
// recursion is not allowed here.

// TODO(EC): Finding a wall path is good, finding a shortest wall path
// is even better.  Note that if S (or T) is a wall, it is a wall path
// of size one, the smallest possible.

// TODO: Write your name in the header!

// For grading, we ignore the main() method, so do what you like with
// that.  We only test your findPath and findWallPath methods.
